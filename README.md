This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data at CMU! 

# About me 
Hello, I am a second year MSPPM student. On campus, I serve as a Teaching Assistant for Business Communication in Tepper, and as a communication consultant at the Global Communication Center. Before studying at Heinz college, I earned my Bachelor of Business Administration from Saint Josephâ€™s University. 

I also spent 1 year working in New York City as an advocate for foster care college funding and youth employment programs. Finally, I spent this past summer working for the Allegheny County Jail Collaborative as a policy researcher. My hobbies include Zumba, tweeting (@CherylRozinski), and blogging.  

# What I hope to learn
I hope to develop my ability to create and critique data visualizations. I also hope to learn some frameworks to help me communicate data findings.
