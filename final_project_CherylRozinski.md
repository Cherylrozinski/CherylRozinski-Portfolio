# Part I
# Summary
The lack of funding invested in U.S. infrastructure is exasperated by the lack of transparency, cumbersome fees, and mismanagement of municipal infrastructure bonds. I will explain the status quo of infrastructure, shed light on the problems, and promote/foreshadow my Systems teams proposed solution (to be published in May 2019). 
# Story Arc
![StoryArc](StoryArc.JPG)

As you can see, my viewers will start with neutral feelings, immediately see staggering (and sad) numbers and be presented with harsh forecasts. Then, we will dig deeper into the problems and causes of our infrastructure failures. Finally, their mood may swing back up to neutral when I present a glimmer of hope (our project). 
# Story Structure
Setup: Infrastructure is falling apart, the forecasts are bleak, and this is hurting citizens. 
Conflict: Infrastructure bonds are opaque, include cumbersome fees, and are riddled by mismanagement. 
Resolution: A team of Heinz College system is proposing federal legislation to change the way bonds are administered. 

# The Data 
I will use media reports, images, and stories to show the status quo of infrastructure. One compelling and recent media report comes from Business Insider. 
https://www.businessinsider.com/asce-gives-us-infrastructure-a-d-2017-3#aviation-d-1
I will use the American Society of Civil Engineers data to show current spending versus needed spending on infrastructure, which is accessible here.
https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/the-impact/economic-impact/ 


**To show the lack of transparency:**
I will explain current law around reporting requirements for muni bonds, or find a video that can. (Please note, this may be cut if I cannot find a simple way to describe it). 

**To show the cumbersome fees:**
I will *attempt* to create an infographic and show how money flows. I will try to find documentation of average fees for underwriters, lawyers, and accountants, but may have to cite estimates from Professor Robert Strauss, who is a financial expert and is also our Systems Advisor. 

**To show mismanagement:**
I will show this data and explain why “refunding” should never need to happen but often does. I will also try to look for a graphic to explain the refunding process. Finally, I will highlight the lack of use of sinking funds as a reason (and one that we hope to solve in our proposal).

To explain why this proposal is necessary in a future of uncertainty, I will show this video.

Finally, I will preview our proposal, which includes **8 steps.** I will try to do this using an infographic.  

# Method and Medium 
For the stories and images to show the state of the infrastructure problem, I will look for photos or panoramic to build a 360 view on this site: https://scene.knightlab.com/ . 
In addition, I will browse media and podcasts to see if there are any powerful voices talking about this problem, who I might be able to embed a quote from using http://soundcite.knightlab.com/ .
I will make my graphs in **Datawrapper,** and my infographic in **Infogram.** 
To put the entire presentation together, I will use **Shorthand.**
# Shorthand Tips to Incorporate
# Planning Tips
1) Break the story down (above), 2) Start beyond a front cover (with maximize impact), 3) Never ending engagement (call to action), 4) Deadlines (build in time for feedback), 5) Flow & Focus (to ensure it’s easy to follow), 6) Performance (make sure my media is viewable on devices), 7) Use media & interactivity with meaning (must bring something to the story), 8) Using Word (check formatting or save as plain text), 
# Design Tips
1) Start simple (clean with headers), 2) Mobile based use, 3) Headers & pull-quotes to add signals (chunked), 4) Style consistency, 5) Watch the eyes of people/animals (don’t cover)
# Publishing Tips
1) Confident with hosting process (ask questions to TA/Professor if needed), 2) Analytics (data to track)
# Promotion Tips 
1) Thinking beyond the headline (build up an audience, clue or question that entices reader to step into the story, quote cards, moving gifs) 

# Part II 
Shorthand Preview: https://preview.shorthand.com/QBW1ihFshlkR306i
# a. Target Audience
The target audience of my proposal is Congress. I want them to understand the urgency needed in their response to the state of our infrastructure. I also want them to realize that the financing structures are one of the key problems causing our infrastructure challenges. 

# b. Finding Representative Individuals
Unfortunately, I cannot interview Congressional members. However, I have interviewed 2 members of my systems team (on this project), my systems advisor, my brother (accounting major in college), and my best friend (PhD candidate in Psychology). I have 3 people with a lot of knowledge on the topic and 2 with little to no knowledge of the topic. 

# c. Interview Script
My goal today is to get feedback on an infographic and chart that my team is designing (I did not want to say me to my family/friend to avoid them being overly nice). I am talking to see what makes sense and what is unclear. I would like you to be as honest as possible, as my team and I are hoping to end with the most-polished and clear final product that we possibly can.  
Infographic: 
1.	Do you know what this is representing? 
2.	Can you describe the relationships between different parties? 
3.	Is any connection hard to interpret? 

Graphs: 
1.	Do you know what this is representing? 
2.	Can you think of anything to add or change to make this more clear? 

# d. Interview Findings 

# Infogram
•	Broad bullet points of the plan
•	Be more concise in the “to ensure” statements. 
•	Add an example to the bonds useful life proposal. Possibly move the useful life bullet to the first point because it explains the bonds. 
•	Define safe public securities on the last bullet points. 


# Project Infrastructure Gap
•	Add billions of dollars
Shorthand text: Severe Gaps don’t match “what does this mean people?”  delete most severe gaps sentence? Or add a connecting sentence (other concerns).

# Bond Issuance flow charts
•	Need to add key on what the lines mean
•	Inv = investor
•	Switch order of “Mayor” and “public authority” 
•	Possibly based this off of an example
•	Add assumptions to graphic

# Bonds by type
•	Add a clearer definition of each type of bond 
•	Add a clearer x-axis label – include the months at the bottom.
•	Add a clearer y-axis key or percentage?
•	The description does not match – should average multiple years instead of just 2018

# Municipal Bond Issues by Type
•	Need to add (in millions), add year of data. 
•	Need to add dollar signs, possibly break into 2 charts because amount and number are not on the same scale – have a double bar chart (with new money issues in one color, and refunding issues in another color) or have number and amount as different colors to show clearer grouping. 
•	Key at the bottom to represent number and amount. 
•	Key at the top is pointless right now (does not tell the user much) because it does not apply to both. 
•	Add source for the data. 
•	Systems team member said to show amount only

# Proposal for Qualified Municipal Infrastructure Bonds
•	Summarize “the solution” in 1 sentence before this infogram
•	Add in “(QMIB)” in the title
•	Make sure to give a brief definition of sinking funds and avoid unnecessary jargon
•	Not enough explanation of generational equity earlier on in the proposal 
•	Change “maturity” to “financing period” 


# e. Implemented Changes
I implemented the outlined changes and more that were shared with me during subsequent interviews. For example, I met with a GCC tutor who helped me better tell a story about the problems with the municipal bond market. She helped me brainstorm how I could use approachable language to describe the problems, and how I could visualize each problem. 

# Part III. Final Data Story 
# Intended Audience & Persona 
As stated above, the intended audience is Congress. However, there are so many more stakeholder groups that this project could reach before Congress. For example, our Systems team would like to use this shorthand story to share with non-experts (specifically other Heinz Students) to help them understand the basic content and importance of our report. We can assume that everyone looking at this will have some level of awareness of financial markets, and at least a bachelors degree. 

Given this information, I will describe 2 personas -- elected officials and Heinz college students. 

# Persona #1 - A Congressional Member or Elected Officals
Purpose: To understand why the QMIB proposal must be adopted if we want to better fund infrastructure. 
Goals: To present the content in a way that feels approachable, interesting, engaging, and that makes the reader want to review each portion. 
Personal: Congressional members are between 29 and 80+ with an average age of 57.8 for the House and 61.8 for the Senate. 21.2% are female and the rest are male. All Senators hold Bachelors degrees and 94.1% of House members do, while 76% of Senators and 16% of House members hold degress beyond a Bachelors. 
Professional: The most frequent previous occupations of Congressional members are - public service, business, law, and education. They will come to the site to help them make a decision about whether to sponsor, support, or oppose our QMIB proposal. Their staff also may be the primary readers and choose what inforamtion from our site to share. They will access the site from government computers, so we will need to confirm that shorthand is not blocked. Some may look on their phones, although that would likely only be if they had to vote on our proposal, in which case we will create a more robust information package. They may get some information about this from the local governments that they represent who may not be in support. However, we highlight that partaking is optional, so we do not expect this to hinder their decisions. 
Technical: Most Congress members have phones and use laptops. They also likely read a lot of media reports, so presenting the content visually - in a way that they are used to seeing on the NYTimes or other news outlets - will likely feel familiar and comfortable for them. My guess is that many Congressional members do not browse through the web, but instead are sent direct links, stories, or sites to look at with directions on what to look for. 
User Motivation: Congressional members are motivated by proposals that will help their constituents. We believe this proposal will save taxpayer dollars and help constituents. They are looking for a reason to support the proposal and looking to see that their support is low risk (meaning that it will not come back to bite them).

# Individual Persona of a Congressional Member
Personal: 57.8 years old, male, Bachelors degree in politics, House member, been in the house for 8 years. 
Professional: He has 20 years of experience in political organization and lobbying before he was elected to Congress. He has a good sense of how money moves in society, and specific experience in seeing how cash flows to fund public projects. Over the past 8 years, he has grown fond of his legislative director and chief of staff. The 3 are inseperable and he trusts their opinions on key legislative proposals. He will be looking to them for help deciding whether to be in favor of implementing a QMIB program. 
Technical: He thinks Congressional meetings are boring, so is often reading reports and looking over material on his phone while sitting on the House floor. He's not afraid of lengthy reports, but definitely appreciates a strong summary to help him get a high level overview. This is especially vital since at any moment he might be asked by the media or constituent groups to share his opinion on any piece of upcoming legislation. 
User motivation: He is from a suburban district where the state of the areas roads are a constant criticism from constituents. In addition, he has two parks in his district that are also in need of many repairs. He is interested in aiding in the solution of the infrastructure problem; however, he has other top priorities. He is likely to support on this issue, but unlikely to lead. 

# Persona #2 - Heinz College stakeholders 
Purpose: to help them understand the basic content and importance of our report.
Goals: these viewers are able to digest this information and begin to ask questions.
Personal: Most Heinz College viewers will be between the ages of 23 and 35, with diverse cultural and country background. They will be pursuing masters degrees in public policy or info systems and have an excellent understand of the impact of data on public-sector decisions. 
Professional: Most Heinz College viewers will have 0 - 10 years of work experience in various industries. They will bring diverse perspectives to our work and likely be able to ask meaningful questions that help us notice areas that we missed. They will come to the site out of support for the work we are doing and out of curiousity about our progress. They will have some knowledge of social impact bonds, local government financial practices, and accounting practices from previous courses. They will access this site on their computer as it will be sent in a direct email to them. 
Technical: Heinz College students are very technially savvy and use multiple robust software applications on a regular basis. They access the web on their computers. 
User Motivation: Heinz College students are motivated by their interest in the topic, and their desire to support their peers. They are also generally driven by the process of gaining knowledge. 

# Individual Persona of a Heinz College Student
Personal: 27 years old, female, Seeking a masters degree in public policy, wants to work in government at the state or local level after graduation. 
Professional: She has 4 years of work experience for a thinktank before coming back to earn her masters. She is interested in government financing, but will likely not seek jobs in this specific industry. 
Technical: She will be able to understand our data-findings, but will also likely be thankful for our visual representations of the problem. 
User Motivation: She is friends with 3 people on the team and has become interested in the topic while discussing with her friends. She sees how this knowledge might be relevant to her career and will look over our site with eagerness and a willingness to ask questions.

# Implications of personas
Given these two general and individual personas, I created a problem --> solution story. I started very broad with the problem with infrastructure and linked in to the emotions of my viewer. Then, I presented all of the problems with the municipal bond market by using visual graphics to explain these issues. I also simplified the concepts (and tried to add metaphorical language) to make sure that my viewers could understand each idea. I gained lots of feedback from "general public" members who do not have much experience in the bond market to help me accomplish this objective. I also tried to create a summary line (in the problems) followed by a description and the same in the solutions. These brief summaries helped my readers get bite sized information on concepts that they already understand and then read on when they do not know much about the topic. In addition, to help my viewers understand the story more clearly, I broke it into 3 parts so that they could easily see my transitions. Finally, by numbering the problems and solutions, viewers can easily see the connection between the dense material. 

# Design Decisions 
The hardest decisions throughout this process was story structure and order of content. It was difficult to figure out how to best place the many problems to maximize viewer comprehension. I used a process of writing each problem on a slip of paper and working with a communication tutor to place them in an order that made sense to both of us (given our very different levels of expertise and investment in the project). In addtion, there were 4 problems that I struggled to visualize, especially in a way that would aid viewer comprehension. To solve this problem, I sketched out many diagrams and sought initial feelback to get to something that would aid viewer comprehension.  


# Reflection through the Process
The most valuable lesson that I learned is the power of getting feedback from different types of stakeholders - from people with no knowledge of the content to experts (Professor Strauss). I also gained a lot from the iterative process of getting feedback multiple times from more important stakeholders.
