# Summary
The lack of funding invested in U.S. infrastructure is exasperated by the lack of transparency, cumbersome fees, and mismanagement of municipal infrastructure bonds. I will explain the status quo of infrastructure, shed light on the problems, and promote/foreshadow my Systems teams proposed solution (to be published in May 2019). 
# Story Arc
![StoryArc](StoryArc.JPG)

As you can see, my viewers will start with neutral feelings, immediately see staggering (and sad) numbers and be presented with harsh forecasts. Then, we will dig deeper into the problems and causes of our infrastructure failures. Finally, their mood may swing back up to neutral when I present a glimmer of hope (our project). 
# Story Structure
Setup: Infrastructure is falling apart, the forecasts are bleak, and this is hurting citizens. 
Conflict: Infrastructure bonds are opaque, include cumbersome fees, and are riddled by mismanagement. 
Resolution: A team of Heinz College system is proposing federal legislation to change the way bonds are administered. 

# The Data 
I will use media reports, images, and stories to show the status quo of infrastructure. One compelling and recent media report comes from Business Insider.

I will use the American Society of Civil Engineers data to show current spending versus needed spending on infrastructure, which is accessible here.

**To show the lack of transparency:**
I will explain current law around reporting requirements for muni bonds, or find a video that can. (Please note, this may be cut if I cannot find a simple way to describe it). 

**To show the cumbersome fees:**
I will *attempt* to create an infographic and show how money flows. I will try to find documentation of average fees for underwriters, lawyers, and accountants, but may have to cite estimates from Professor Robert Strauss, who is a financial expert and is also our Systems Advisor. 

**To show mismanagement:**
I will show this data and explain why “refunding” should never need to happen but often does. I will also try to look for a graphic to explain the refunding process. Finally, I will highlight the lack of use of sinking funds as a reason (and one that we hope to solve in our proposal).

To explain why this proposal is necessary in a future of uncertainty, I will show this video.

Finally, I will preview our proposal, which includes **8 steps.** I will try to do this using an infographic.  

# Method and Medium 
For the stories and images to show the state of the infrastructure problem, I will look for photos or panoramic to build a 360 view on this site: https://scene.knightlab.com/ . 
In addition, I will browse media and podcasts to see if there are any powerful voices talking about this problem, who I might be able to embed a quote from using http://soundcite.knightlab.com/ .
I will make my graphs in **Datawrapper,** and my infographic in **Infogram.** 
To put the entire presentation together, I will use **Shorthand.**
# Shorthand Tips to Incorporate
# Planning Tips
1) Break the story down (above), 2) Start beyond a front cover (with maximize impact), 3) Never ending engagement (call to action), 4) Deadlines (build in time for feedback), 5) Flow & Focus (to ensure it’s easy to follow), 6) Performance (make sure my media is viewable on devices), 7) Use media & interactivity with meaning (must bring something to the story), 8) Using Word (check formatting or save as plain text), 
# Design Tips
1) Start simple (clean with headers), 2) Mobile based use, 3) Headers & pull-quotes to add signals (chunked), 4) Style consistency, 5) Watch the eyes of people/animals (don’t cover)
# Publishing Tips
1) Confident with hosting process (ask questions to TA/Professor if needed), 2) Analytics (data to track)
# Promotion Tips 
1) Thinking beyond the headline (build up an audience, clue or question that entices reader to step into the story, quote cards, moving gifs)
